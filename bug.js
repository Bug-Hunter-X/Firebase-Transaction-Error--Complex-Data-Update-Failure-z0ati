The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws an error when attempting to update data with a transaction that involves a complex data structure or a large amount of data.  The error message might be vague, not directly pointing to the cause, often related to network issues or internal Firebase limitations.  For example, a transaction updating nested objects with many child nodes might fail intermittently.
